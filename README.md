# Club BIAM Dashboard (Toastmasters)

This is a web application that enables the board member of the club BIAM (a Toastmasters club) to keep track of all participations of the active members since 2020.

The objective is to provide the board a yearly, monthly and individual analysis of all the members to know which roles they have been covered so and their progress in actively participating in the sessions. In this way, the Vicepresident of Education could strategically encourage people with poor participations
to return to sessions as well as praise people with constant partitipations in the club.

This project started in 2020, but it is still under constant development.
